# Module-19-Challenge

# Hello grader of my project!!

I just wanted to let u know, this one isnt working well. I was working on it and because my computer ran out of storage, I tried deleting node modules from different projects and stuff, among which was this Module 19 one, and when I tried to do a commit it said no too many changes bla bla bla. And because of time and all, I decided to pretty much start over. This is the link for the one that IS the module 19 challenge: text editor. I didn't know if I could submit again before it was graded, so I'm going to paste the link to clone and repository here. For your comprehension, Thank you!
